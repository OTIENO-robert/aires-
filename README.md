Below is a sample README.md file for your Django backend. You can add this file to your repository so your group members have clear setup instructions:

# AIRES-SYS-BACKEND

## Overview

This repository contains the Django backend for the AI Resume Scanner project. The backend handles API endpoints for resume analysis and chat functionality. It connects to a PostgreSQL database and is built with Django.

## Prerequisites

Before setting up the project, ensure you have the following installed:
- [Python 3.8+](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
- [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installation/)
- [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/download/) (or an external PostgreSQL service)
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Clone the Repository

Open your terminal and run:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Gymnott1/AIRES-SYS-BACKEND.git
cd AIRES-SYS-BACKEND
2. Create and Activate a Virtual Environment
For macOS/Linux:

python3 -m venv env
source env/bin/activate
For Windows:

python -m venv env
env\Scripts\activate
3. Install Dependencies
Install the required packages:

pip install -r requirements.txt
4. Configure Environment Variables
Create a .env file in the root directory and add your configuration:

SECRET_KEY=your_django_secret_key
DEBUG=True  # Set to False in production
DATABASE_NAME=your_database_name
DATABASE_USER=your_database_user
DATABASE_PASSWORD=your_database_password
DATABASE_HOST=localhost
DATABASE_PORT=5432
Tip: Never hardcode sensitive information in your code. Use environment variables to manage secrets.

5. Apply Database Migrations
Set up your database by running:

python manage.py migrate
6. Create a Superuser (Optional)
To access the Django admin panel, create an admin user:

python manage.py createsuperuser
7. Run the Development Server
Start the server with:

python manage.py runserver
Your backend will be accessible at http://127.0.0.1:8000.

API Endpoints
The backend provides the following endpoints:

Analyze Resume: http://localhost:8000/api/analyze_resume/
Chat Messages: http://localhost:8000/api/chat-messages/
Chat: http://localhost:8000/api/chat/
Ensure the frontend is configured to call these endpoints.

Handling Secrets
GitHub push protection may block pushes if secrets are detected. If you encounter such issues:

Remove any hardcoded secrets from your code.
Remove affected commits from your history (using tools like interactive rebase or BFG Repo-Cleaner).
Always use environment variables to manage sensitive data.
Useful Commands
Start Server:
python manage.py runserver
Apply Migrations:
python manage.py migrate
Create Superuser:
python manage.py createsuperuser
Run Tests:
python manage.py test
Troubleshooting
Environment Variables:
Ensure your .env file is properly configured and that your settings file loads it correctly (consider using django-environ).
Database Connection:
Confirm that PostgreSQL is running and that the credentials in your .env file are accurate.
Push Protection:
If GitHub blocks your push due to secrets, follow the provided GitHub documentation to resolve the issue.
